## [IEEEXtreme Programming Competition <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Oct 2024)</span>](https://ieeextreme.org)
ERAU ranked in the top 37% of over 8,000 global teams in a 24-hour programming competition. I collaborated with my team to solve coding challenges, where we optimized algorithms for speed and efficient memory usage in Python, C, and C++.

## [Differential Equations Honors Project <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2024 – May 2024)</span>](diffeq.md)
I engineered a Python program that simulates the behavior of 10 unique mass-spring systems using data visualization libraries. This program provides graphical representations of second-order differential equations, serving as a valuable learning tool for future engineering students.

## [NASA RASC-AL Competition <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2024 – May 2024)</span>](chonk.md)
I conducted collaborative research with a team of 50 students, focusing on design and innovative concepts to enhance human space exploration. I computed and plotted mission trajectories for launch, transfer orbit, reentry, and landing using MATLAB.

## Graphical Communications Final Project <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Aug 2023 - Dec 2023)</span>
(Picture+Caption)
I designed a realistic 3D CAD model of a toaster in CATIA V5 with accurate dimensions. I also rendered the simulated model using Houdini SideFX and animated the moving components with lifelike textures and shaders.

## 3D Multiplayer Minigame in Unity <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2022 - Aug 2022)</span>
(Picture+Caption)
I developed a 4-player minigame in C# using the Unity Engine, integrating open-source libraries to create object physics interactions that enhanced user experience and increased player engagement. I created a virtual environment by implementing detailed 3D models of trees and plants.
