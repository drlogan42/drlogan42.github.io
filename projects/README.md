## [IEEEXtreme Programming Competition <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Oct 2024)</span>](https://ieeextreme.org)
ERAU ranked in the top 37% of over 8,000 global teams in a 24-hour programming competition. I collaborated with my team to solve coding challenges, where we optimized algorithms for speed and efficient memory usage in Python, C, and C++.

## [Differential Equations Honors Project <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2024 – May 2024)</span>](diffeq.md)
I engineered a Python program that simulates the behavior of 10 unique mass-spring systems using data visualization libraries. This program provides graphical representations of second-order differential equations, serving as a valuable learning tool for future engineering students.

## [NASA RASC-AL Competition <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2024 – May 2024)</span>](chonk.md)
I conducted collaborative research with a team of 50 students, focusing on design and innovative concepts to enhance human space exploration. I computed and plotted mission trajectories for launch, transfer orbit, reentry, and landing using MATLAB.
