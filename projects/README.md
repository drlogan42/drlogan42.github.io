<p style="font-size: 1rem; color: grey;">The ball balancing platform in all of its glory.</p>
I, alongside two others created a ball balancing platform for our junior design project. The platform reacts to any inputs atop a resistive screen which reads inputs, sends them to an Arduino, calculates the position of the stepper motors to turn and moves the platform in a way that balances a steel ball when rolled onto the top. I programmed the algorithms for the Inverse Kinematics which determined the position the arms must be oriented in order to move the ball to the platform. I also coded the PID algorithm, which found how much the ball needed to move to get to the center. All programming was in C++ using Arduino and CAD was modelled using Fusion 360.

## [Project S.H.I.N.E – Microcomputers & Electronics Final Project <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2025 - Apr 2025)</span>](https://github.com/drlogan42/EP340-Junior-Design)

<p style="font-size: 1rem; color: grey;">The ball balancing platform in all of its glory.</p>
In my Microcomputers and Electronics Instrumentation course, my final project was building project S.H.I.N.E. or Solar Harnessing Intelligent Navigator for Exploration, a CubeSat like apparatus that is an environment sensing sun tracker. My team built the tracker in C using an AVR microcontroller to remotely monitors power, temperature, direction, and light levels to accurately swivel to track an artificial light source while displaying data in real time to a ground station. I was in charge of constructing the power and monitoring subsystems that precisely track all voltage and current levels in the project.

## [Spark Jam 2025 - Tainted Blood <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Feb 2025)</span>](https://drlogan42.itch.io)
![Screenshot](sparkjamcover.png){:.lead width="685" height="425" loading="lazy"}
<p style="font-size: 1rem; color: grey;">Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's first annual SparkJam.</p>
I participated in the first annual ERAU SparkJam event hosted by the Game Development club. The theme of the Jam was "Vampirism" and teams were given 42hrs to complete a video game. I worked as a solo developer where I utilized my prior programming experience and leveraged it with GSScript in the Godot Engine. I gained valuable experience with prototyping, game mechanics, iteration, storyboarding, level design, and 2D asset design. Additionally, the pressure of a 42hr deadline gave me crucial experience with adaptability, decision making, time management, and designing the overall direction of the game.

## [IEEEXtreme Programming Competition <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Oct 2024)</span>](https://ieeextreme.org)
ERAU ranked in the top 37% of over 8,000 global teams in a 24-hour programming competition. I collaborated with my team to solve coding challenges, where we optimized algorithms for speed and efficient memory usage in Python, C, and C++.

## [Differential Equations Honors Project <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2024 – May 2024)</span>](diffeq.md)
I engineered a Python program that simulates the behavior of 10 unique mass-spring systems using data visualization libraries. This program provides graphical representations of second-order differential equations, serving as a valuable learning tool for future engineering students.

## [NASA RASC-AL Competition <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2024 – May 2024)</span>](chonk.md)
I conducted collaborative research with a team of 50 students, focusing on design and innovative concepts to enhance human space exploration. I computed and plotted mission trajectories for launch, transfer orbit, reentry, and landing using MATLAB.

## Graphical Communications Final Project <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Aug 2023 - Dec 2023)</span>

<p style="font-size: 1rem; color: grey;">Final rendering of the toaster model with shading.</p>
I designed a realistic 3D CAD model of a toaster in CATIA V5 with accurate dimensions. I also rendered the simulated model using Houdini SideFX and animated the moving components with lifelike textures and shaders.

## 3D Multiplayer Minigame in Unity <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Jan 2022 - Aug 2022)</span>
![Screenshot](initaldevimage.png){:width="685" height="425" loading="lazy"}
<p style="font-size: 1rem; color: grey;">Early development of player movement and environment.</p>
I developed a 4-player minigame in C# using the Unity Engine, integrating open-source libraries to create object physics interactions that enhanced user experience and increased player engagement. I created a virtual environment by implementing detailed 3D models of trees and plants.
