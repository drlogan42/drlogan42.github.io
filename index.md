Hi, I'm Logan. I apply my background in Engineering Physics to build innovative, immersive software. Currently, I am a senior at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a Lead Developer at the Extended Reality (XR) Lab. My work sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, physics, and immersive simulation.

My concentration in Spacecraft Instrumentation has equipped me with a strong technical foundation in:

    Math & Physics: Classical Mechanics, Astrophysics, E&M, and Signals & Systems.

    Hardware & Code: Microcomputers, Digital Circuit Design, and Digital Signal Processing.

I am passionate about the Internet of Things (IoT), Graphics, and Immersion—specifically how these technologies can extend human capabilities. This portfolio showcases how I leverage my experience to design and build unique interactive software.
