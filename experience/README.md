<h1 style="font-size: 3rem;">Research</h1>
## NSF REU Intern <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(May 2024 â€“ Jul 2024)</span>
(INSERT PICTURE HERE)
I conducted mechanical characterization of self-healing PDMS-based polymers through tensile testing to evaluate healing efficiency. During this process, I discovered a 30% increase in healing performance when alcohol was introduced during the repair process. I developed Python scripts to automate the analysis of force and distance data, which saved over 10 hours per week while improving the accuracy of stress and strain calculations through repeatable tests. Additionally, I integrated a sensor and an Arduino microcontroller into the tensile tester, enabling real-time distance measurement that improved strain rate precision by 15%.

## Physics Tutor <span style="font-size: small; color: gray;">(Sept 2023 - Present)</span>
I boosted the student pass rate by 9% in introductory physics courses over the course of a year. I instruct up to 40 students at a time on core concepts and numerical questions, emphasizing group engagement to enhance learning. I collaborate with co-tutors to align sessions with course objectives, adjusting pacing and structure to optimize student learning outcomes.
